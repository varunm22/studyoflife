            <h2>External Links and Handouts</h2>

            <p>These are resources that Varun, Yilun, and other participants of the USABO have found useful in studying.</p>

            <h6>Cell and Molecular Biology</h6>

            <p>Most of the cell biology questions will be based on Campbell's, though questions often test biotechnology procedures in depth. These are extensively covered in Albert's Molecular Biology of the Cell, specifically in chapters 8 and 9. For some practice with higher level molecular biology problems, take a look at our practice set here:<a href="tests.html"> here</a>.</p>


            <p><a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/chromatography">Chromatography</a> - This website goes over several types of chromatography, all of which are important to USABO, and have shown up in past exams. Be sure to understand the principles behind each of these chromatography techniques.

            <h6>Genetics and Evolution</h6>

            <p>While Campbell's covers most of the genetics and evolution you need to know, you can get practice with more obscure genetics concepts with with good genetics problems through MIT's online course <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-03-genetics-fall-2004/">here</a> or through the course page for a North Dakota State University course <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/431g.htm">here</a>.</p>

            <p>At the NDSU link, one of the important categories is here: <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/mendel/">Mendalian Genetics</a>. From this link, study the chi square test, epistasis, pleiotropy, and penetrance and expressivity. Another important category from the NDSU link is here: <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/linkage/">Genetic Linkage</a>. From this link, study the triple point cross and measuring linkage in humans. Finally, in the <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/mutation/mutation5.htm">Genes and Mutation</a> category, study Complementation.</p>

            <h6>Biosystematics</h6>

            <p>While Biosystematics is pretty important, it involves a lot of memorization, so you may want to save it until after you have a good hold on the other subjects. When you start studying biosystematics, our handout <a href="diversityhandout.pdf">here</a> is a good place to start.</p>

            <h6>Plant Anatomy and Physiology</h6>

            <p>Campbell's does not cover plant anatomy and physiology at the depth required for USABO, so we suggest reading select chapters of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raven-Biology-Plants-Ray-Evert/dp/1429219610">Raven's plant biology</a>. Specifically, look at chapters 2, 19, 20, and 22-30. Pay special attention to the diagrams and identifying major anatomical features/cells. For more specific information, take a look at the handouts below:</p>

            <p>Through this University of Rhode Island <a href="http://www.uri.edu/cels/bio/plant_anatomy/images.html#lab_2">class page</a>, practice identifying dicot/monocot root and stem sections, as well as the cell types within them.</p>

            <p>Through this University of Central Oklahoma <a href="http://biology.uco.edu/bidlack/botany/notes.htm">class page</a>, study especially lecture notes on roots and stems.</p>


            <h6>Animal Anatomy and Physiology</h6>

            <p>Animal anatomy and physiology is generally pretty well covered in Campbell's, though some questions may reference other physiology concepts. A good book for post-Campbell's studying is <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/BRS-Physiology-Board-Review-Series/dp/0781798760">BRS Physiology</a>.</p>

            <p>Some topics to REALLY know in Campbell's: everything about hormones, disorders, and feedback cycles. Additionally, some semifinal tests will test histology, which isn't really covered in Campbell's, but is presented in the links below.</p>

            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folliculogenesis">Folliculogenesis</a> - Know each stage of folliculogenesis</p>

            <p><a href="http://histology.med.umich.edu/virtual-slide-indexl"> Histology Slides</a> - Be able to identify major organs/blood cells</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.healthgrades.com/conditions/endocrine-disorders--symptoms ">Hormonal Inbalence Diseases</a> - Be able to identify characteristics of each of the above mentioned diseases, names are not important</p>

            <p><a href="http://quizlet.com/16151353/chapter-24-transport-of-oxygen-flash-cards/">Hemoglobin</a> - Understand the dynamics of picking up and dropping Oxygen</p>

            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_morphology">Insect Morphology</a> - Know the parts of the legs and the mouth parts</p>

            <h6>Ethology (Animal Behavior)</h6>

            <p>The ethology section, which is 5% of the test, mostly comes from just one chapter of Campbell's. Make sure to know Chapter 51 really well. Additionally, look at the links below and do lots of practice problems. Understand coefficient of relatedness, as this comes up on almost every semifinals test.</p>

            <p>The sparknotes study guide for <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/biology/">Animal Behavior</a> (found at the bottom of the page) sums up a lot of information from in and out of Campbell's.</p>

            <p>This link on <a href="http://www.genetic-genealogy.co.uk/Toc115570135.html">Coefficient of Relatedness</a> gives a heuristic method of calculating coefficient of relatedness that is very helpful. Practice your skills with the practice problems at the end of the page.</p>

            <p>If you think you have coefficient of relatedness down, try problems on <a href="http://www.bumblebee.org/Haplodiploidy.htm">Bumblebee Coefficient of Relatedness</a>! Under what situations would it be advantageous for drones to take care of the queen's offspring rather than their own offspring? </p>

            <h6>Ecology</h6>

            <p>While ecology is 10% of the IBO test and National olympiad tests, most questions are fairly easy and involve material right out of Campbell's. Things not covered in Campbell that shows up on occassion are life tables, game theory, and statistics. Life tables and basic statistics show up often in semifinals tests, though game theory is often more reserved for National Finals tests. </p>

            <p>Sparknotes gives a good summary of <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/biology/animalbehavior/behavioralecology/">Behavorial Ecology</a>, a mix between ethology and ecology, that isn't too well covered by Campbells.</p>

            <p>The Wikipedia page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory">Evolutionary Game Theory</a> sums up most of what you'd need to know at the semifinals or finals level of USABO.</p>

            <p>This PDF covers <a href="lifetables.pdf">Population Tables</a>. These have shown up a lot of USABO semifinals tests, especially in the FRQ section.</p>

            <h6>Miscellaneous</h6>

            <p>There are some general subjects that will show up in biology courses and competitions that can't really be clumped into specific subjects, such as statistics and chemistry. These, along with other general resources are linked below.</p>

            <p>Our handout on <a href="biostats.pdf">Biostatistics</a> addresses most of the statistics you need to know for USABO.</p>

            <p>Relevant topics in <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/chemistry/">chemistry</a> are explained in this link from Sparknotes. Make sure to read about stoichiometric calculations, molarity, reaction kinetics, and acid/base reactions (especially with buffers).</p>

            <p>The <a href="iboguide.pdf">Guide to IBO</a> discusses many theoretical and practical aspects of the IBO, many of which pertain to USABO.</p>

            <p><a href="varunoutline.pdf">This</a> is a partial outline of Campbell's made by Varun.</p>

            <p><a href="shulinoutline.pdf">This</a> is a partial outline of Campbell's made by Shulin Ye, a previous member of Team USA.</p>
